xsbt-cucumber-plugin
====================

An [sbt 0.10](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki) plugin for running [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) features under [cuke4duke](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cuke4duke).

Provides the ability to run Cucumber via Cuke4Duke within the SBT environment. Originally based on the [cuke4duke-sbt-plugin](https://github.com/rubbish/cuke4duke-sbt-plugin) by rubbish and my original implementation for SBT 0.7.x. Specifics for this release:

* Works with xsbt 0.10.1
* Works with Cucumber 1.0.0
* Works with cuke4duke 0.4.4
* Allows projects compiled and running against Scala 2.8.x and 2.9.x

## Usage ##
Install the plugin (see later). Be default features files go in a 'features' directory at the root of the project. Step definitions go in "src/test/scala'. Finally from the sbt console call the task:

    cucumber

The cucumber task can be parameterised with tags or feature names to provide fine grained control of which features get executed. E.g.

    cucumber @demo,~@in-progress

would run features tagged as @demo and not those tagged as @in-progress. Also:

    cucumber "User admin"

would run features with a name matched to "User admin". Multiple arguments can be supplied and honour the following rules:

* arguments starting with @ or ~ will be passed to cucumber using the --tags flag
* arguments starting with anything else will be passed to cucumber using the --name flag

## Writing Features ##
Features are written in text format and are placed in .feature files inside the 'features' directory. For more info on writing features please see the [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) website.
For example:

    Feature: Cucumber
      In order to implement BDD in my Scala project
      As a developer
      I want to be able to run Cucumber from with SBT

      Scenario: Execute feature with console output
        Given A SBT project
        When I run the cucumber goal
        Then Cucumber is executed against my features and step definitions

The location of the features can be changed by overriding a plugin setting (see below).

## Writing Step Defitions ##
Step definitions can be written in Scala, using the cuke4duke Scala DSL. More information on this api can be obtained from the the [cuke4duke wiki page for scala](http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cuke4duke/scala).
For example:

    import cuke4duke.{EN, ScalaDsl}
    import org.scalatest.matchers.ShouldMatchers

    class CucumberSteps extends ScalaDsl with EN with ShouldMatchers {

      private var givenCalled = false
      private var whenCalled = false

      Given("""^A SBT project$""") {
        givenCalled = true
      }

      When("""^I run the cucumber goal$""") {
        whenCalled = true
      }

      Then("""^Cucumber is executed against my features and step definitions$""") {
        givenCalled should be (true)
        whenCalled should be (true)
      }
    }

## Project Setup ##
To install the cucumber plugin, add entries to the build plugins file (project/plugins/build.sbt) as follows:

    resolvers += "Templemore Repository" at "http://templemore.co.uk/repo"

    libraryDependencies += "templemore" %% "xsbt-cucumber-plugin" % "0.2"

### Basic Configuration ###
To add the cucumber plugin settings to a basic project, just add the following to the build.sbt file:

    seq(cucumberSettings : _*)

The testProjects/testProject in the plugin source repository shows this configuration.

### Full Configuration ###
To add the cucumber plugin settings to a full configuration (often a multi-module) project, the best way is to implement a project/Build.scala file:

    import sbt._
    import Keys._
    import templemore.xsbt.cucumber.CucumberPlugin

    object TestProjectBuild extends Build {
        import Dependencies._
        import BuildSettings._

        lazy val myProject = Project ("my-project", file ("."),
                                      settings = Defaults.defaultSettings ++ CucumberPlugin.cucumberSettings)
    }

The testProjects/multiModuleTestProject in the plugin source repository shows this setup in a multi-module project.

## Gems ##
All gems are automatically installed the first time that the cucumber plugin is run. These gems are installed to the default location {user.home}/.jruby/gems so that they are cached for all projects using the cucumber plugin. The location of the cache directory can be overridden in the settings.

A task is provided to delete the cache directory contents:

    cucumber-clean-gems

## Customisation ##
The plugin supports a number of customisations and settings. The following settings can be modified to change the behaviour of the plugin:

### Mode ###
* cucumberMode = The mode to run cucumber in. Defaults to the value templemore.xsbt.cucumber.Normal

The four supported modes are:

* templemore.xsbt.cucumber.Normal - Runs cucumber and outputs results to the console
* templemore.xsbt.cucumber.Developer - Runs cucumber and outputs results, snippets and source to the console
* templemore.xsbt.cucumber.HtmlReport - Runs cucumber and outputs an html report of the results
* templemore.xsbt.cucumber.PdfReport - Runs cucumber and outputs a pdf report of the results

### General Settings ###
* cucumberJRubyHome - The location for the JRuby home. Defaults to a java.io.File of {user.home}/.jruby
* cucumberGemDir - The location of the Gem cache directory. Defaults to a java.io.File of {cucumberJRubyHome}/gems
* cucumberMaxMemory - The maximum JVM memory to allocate to the JRuby process. Defaults to the string "256M"
* cucumberMaxPermGen - The maximum PermGen space for the JRuby process. Defaults to the string "64M"

### Gem Settings ###
* cucumberVersion - The version of Cucumber to use. Defaults to the string "1.0.0"
* cucumberCuke4DukeVersion - The version of Cuke4Duke to use. Defaults to the string "0.4.4"
* cucumberPrawnVersion - The version of the Prawn PDF generator to use. Defaults to the string "0.8.4"
* cucumberGemUrl - The URL for downloading Gems. Default to the string "http://rubygems.org/"
* cucumberForceGemReload - Whether to force reloading of all gems, even if they exist in the cache. Defaults to false

### Cucumber Settings ###
* cucumberFeaturesDir - The location of the cucumber features directory within the projects. Defaults to a java.io.File of ./features
* cucumberOptions - Custom options to pass to the cucumber command. Defaults to an empty List[String]

### Output Settings ###
* cucumberHtmlReportFile - The location of the html report file. Defaults fo a java.io.File of ./target/cucumber-report/cucumber.html
* cucumberPdfReportFile - The location of the pdf report file. Defaults fo a java.io.File of ./target/cucumber-report/cucumber.pdf

### Lifecycle Settings ###
* cucumberBefore - A function of type () => Unit that will be run BEFORE cucumber is executed. Defaults to a no-op function
* cucumberAfter - A function of type () => Unit that will be run AFTER cucumber is executed. Defaults to a no-op function

## Roadmap ##

This plugin will continue to track releases of both SBT (0.10 and onwards) and Cucumber. Requests for features can be posted to the issues list or emailed to the author.

## Release History ##

### 0.2 ###
Updated to be compatible with SBT 0.10.1 release. This release contains no code changes, it is just a recompilation with the build properties updated.

### 0.1 ###
Initial release. Complete rewrite of the plugin to support SBT 0.10.
